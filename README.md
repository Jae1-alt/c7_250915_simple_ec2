This project will allow for the creation of an EC2 with custom VPC, Subnet, IGW (and all the necessary niceties).

Its meant to be very flexible; allowing to define your subnet name , number of subnets, VPC (and subsequently subnet) CIDR range, VPC name, and a few other things, all within the variables block.

This config, is eventually meant to serve as module that great usability, but that time will come soon.

Please believe, by no means is this the full readme breakdown of the project. Just taking a break,  I'll soon update this with proper documentation to explain the coding and a lot of the functions special arguments used.
